# YouTube Playlist Support Guide

Your Discord music bot now supports YouTube playlists! Here's how to use this feature:

## How to Add YouTube Playlists

### Method 1: Using the `/play` command
You can now use the `/play` command with YouTube playlist URLs:

```
/play query: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmRdnEQy6nuLMt9xaJGA6H_VjlXEL
```

The bot will automatically detect that it's a playlist and add all tracks to the queue.

### Method 2: Using the new `/playlist` command
For a dedicated playlist experience, use the new `/playlist` command:

```
/playlist url: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmRdnEQy6nuLMt9xaJGA6H_VjlXEL
```

This command is specifically designed for playlists and provides better error handling.
